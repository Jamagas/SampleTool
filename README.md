This sample project depends on EarlGrey V2 https://github.com/google/EarlGrey/blob/earlgrey2/docs/setup.md

Before you can build it you need to fetch dependencies

```
// Clone EarlGrey 2.0
git clone -b earlgrey2 https://github.com/google/EarlGrey.git

// Download any dependencies. Run this command from the EarlGrey/ root directory
// as it will download the submodule relative to the location it was called in.
sh Scripts/download_deps.sh
```
